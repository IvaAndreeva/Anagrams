Anagrams
========
Task:

An anagram derivation is a N-letter word derived from a N-1 letter word by adding a letter and rearranging. Write a program that will find the longest such derivation from a 3-letter word in a list of words where every derived word also exists in the list of words. (Process the longest derivations for all the 3 letter words in the dictionary)

So maybe this is not the fastest solution of this problem, but it still works on the dictionary wordsEn.txt which is 100 000+ words.
The solution is written using Python and in the README in anagrams-processor you'll find a full description of the used algorithm.
